##Â Usage

This repo is to showcase various common use-cases and standard practices when developing a web app, as well as demonstrating other relevant functionalities. Usage of basic commands:
- running a local docker registry and push built images to this local registry
  - run with `docker run -d -p 5000:5000 --restart=always --name registry registry:2`
- creating a hello world web app
  - created using Python3 and Flask in a virtual environment
  - run locally with `flask run -p 8080`
  - check functionality in browser @ http://localhost:8080
- creating a Dockerfile to allow for local building and testing of the application
  - build and push to local docker registry with `./build_and_push.sh helloworld-overkill v0.1.0 localhost:5000`
  - test functionality with `docker run --rm -p 8080:8080 localhost:5000/helloworld-overkill:latest`
  - check functionality in browser @ http://localhost:8080

## Tagging scheme

Chosen tagging scheme follows standard [semantic versioning](https://semver.org/).
Pre-prod app will be tagged `v0.1.0` and will increase minor/patch version until production ready.

#### Releases

Milestones

Releases follow below steps:
- a tag is created and pushed:

  `git tag -a $TARGET_VERSION -m "First working version of helloworld web app" && git push --tags`

- an issue is opened and closed in github with relevant release summary:

  `gh issue close $(gh issue create -t "release target $TARGET_VERSION" -m "$TARGET_VERSION" -l release-summary -b $RELEASE_SUMMARY | tail -n1 | cut -d '/' -f7)`

- full and delta changelogs are generated:

  `./generate_changelog.sh && ./generate_changelog.sh -d yes`

- new release is created based on latest pushed tag

  `./release.sh`

- new docker image is built

  `./build_and_push helloworld-overkill $TARGET_VERSION`

- create new future milestone if needed

  ```
    echo '{
      "title": "$FUTURE_TARGET_TAG",
      "state": "open",
      "due_on": "2022-12-31T23:59:59Z",
      "description": "Description foo bar"
    }' | gh createMilestone
  ```
#### Workarounds

Run following to manage milestones with `gh` (https://github.com/cli/cli/issues/1200):
 `gh alias set --shell createMilestone "gh api --method POST repos/:owner/:repo/milestones --input - | jq '{ html_url: .html_url, state: .state, created_at: .created_at }'"`
